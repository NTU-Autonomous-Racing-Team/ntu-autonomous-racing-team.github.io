The NTU Autonomous Racing Team participates in [F1Tenth](https://f1tenth.org/) competitions around the world, where we compete against teams of undergraduate and graduate students from top universities.  Our car was built from the ground-up by NTU students according to the specifications laid out in th F1Tenth rule-book.  Additionally, we have developped several autonomous racing algorithms.  Currently the team consists of students from MAE, SCSE, and IGP.  If you are an NTU student and interested in joining us, please use this form (requires NTU email login).
